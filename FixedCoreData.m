The solution is to always explicitly save the `NSManagedObjectContext` after making changes.  This should be done within an error handling block to gracefully manage potential save failures.

```objectivec
NSError *error = nil;

// ... your code to create and modify managed objects...

if (![context save:&error]) {
    NSLog("Failed to save context: %@
", error);
    // Handle the error appropriately (e.g., display an alert, retry the save)
}
```

This ensures that changes made to your managed objects are persisted to the persistent store. Remember to handle potential errors during the save operation.
